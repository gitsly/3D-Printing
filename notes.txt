extruders:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap_Options#Extruder

EMO25 extruder, which can extrude such neat materials as play-doh, clay, and self-setting rubber

Cold end:
  popular models:
  * Wade's geared extruder
  * Greg's hinged extruder
  * Greg's Wade's Reloaded extruder
  Seems to be printable with some additional hardware like
  bearings and nuts. I'm gearing towards simply using a metal 
  gear on a stepper motor (that's how it's done on the Zortrax M200)
  Have to research more why this could be a bad idea.
  Seems like the gearing is there to produce more torque? but since
  ABS has less friction than PLA, maybe a single gear will suffice
  for the cold end of the extruder.
  Plenty of parts are available online for making a DIY cold end.


Hot end:
  Thermistor:
  ThermoCouple:


  Bowden extruder:
    + Faster and lighter.
    + less shaking
    + Faster printing
    - Hysteresis. The plastic filament will compress in any extruder, but
      putting pressure on such a long length of filament will multiply the
      effects of this compression, leading to springiness. The flexibility of
      the PFTE tube exacerbates this problem.  It is potentially possible to
      control this problem, perhaps with an encoder just above the hot end.
      Software might also be able to reduce this problem, but would require
      (maybe lengthy) calibration.

    Note: The Bowden extruder is not helpful if you have a fixed printing head
    (or moving in Z-only) and a XY-moving platform.

    A stepper-based extruder is required if no encoder is used.

Where to get:
  (UK also has 3D printing accessories): http://e3d-online.com/

Deltas:

Seems very interesting. Simpler frame construction, seem to have very good
resolution if done right and a lot cooler than just having an ordinary 3D
printer.

Different delta designs:

Sourcing tips and notes
-----------------------
Steel rods (6mm and 8mm are commonly used for 3d printer designs)
the linear bearings available will fit these two sizes.
3DR uses 6mm by default, but there are modified versions out there which can use
8mm.
Where to get in sweden:
  
Online (international sites):

Ebay sources:
  weedo3dprinting (UK), have bearings, filament (PLA/ABS) and misc good metal
  parts

Controller boards
-------------------
RUMBA Basic Board:
  used in 3DR Delta, available from
   * http://www.reprapdiscount.com/electronics/33-rumba-basic-board.html#
   * Dealextreme
   * Alibaba

Printed Parts:
All parts are fine printed in PLA, but you can use ABS if you prefer.

Print the following parts with 30% honeycomb infill, two perimeters, ideally
with a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.25mm or lower layers.

3 x 3DR_Bottom_Motor_Mount_V2_001_RTP.stl
3 x 3DR_Top_Electronics_Mount_V2_001_RTP.stl
3 x 3DR_Top_cover_cap_V2_001_RTP.stl
1 x 3DR_Top_Boss_V2_001_RTP.stl
1 x 3DR_Bottom_Boss_V2_001_RTP.stl

And also the following parts with 35% honeycomb infill, two perimeters, ideally
with a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.15mm or lower layers.

3 x 3DR_Spool_V2_001_RTP.stl
3 x 3DR_Carriage_V2_001_for_LM6UU_RTP.stl

1 x 3DR_micro_platform_V2_001_RTP.stl
3 x 3DR_Print_Bed_catch_V2_001_RTP.stl

These are the pushrods: (other sources are RC or universal TRAXX)
12 x 3DR_RichRap_joint_and_rod_adapter_VERSION2_001_RTP.stl  (use concentric infill)

For the extruder, you can use your own Bowden version or a choice of countless
others, or my version:

1 x 3DR_Extruder_body_V2_Test_001_RTP.stl
1 x RichRap_Greg_style_Guidler_Modified_with_grab_lever_For_1_RTP.stl
1 x herringbone-gear-large.stl
1 x herringbone-gear-small.stl

And the XXL LCD display and SD Card case is highly recommended to finish off your machine - 
This LCD case is a modified version of the excelent design by wersy - design here

1 x 3DR_LCDXXL_Base_RichRap_V2_001_RTP.stl
1 x 3DR_Top_Case_XXL_V2_001_RTP.stl
1 x 3DR_LCDXXL_Controller_knob_V2_001_shorter_RTP.stl
1 x 3DR_LCDXXL_Kill_Button_V2_001_RTP.stl
1 x 3DR_LCD_Adapter_RichRap_V2_001_RTP.stl

Mechanical parts
3 x Aluminium frame sections of 500mm long and
6 x 6mm stainless steel rods 450mm long.
6 x M5 washers (connecting the Plastic parts to the Aluminium frame)
6 x M5 T-slot nuts for the Aluminium channel - I recommend getting more and adding them into all the channels so you can attach extruders, fans and other things to the machine
6 x M5 x10/12mm Socket cap or dome bolts
20 x M4 x12mm Socket cap or dome bolts for connecting most of the plastic parts together, and mounting the LCD adapter.
40 x M4 washers - use on the above
20 x M4 Crinkle washers - use on the above
20 x M4 nuts (You can use Nylock nuts in many places rather than the Crinkle washers and normal nuts, but you need at least 4 x normal M4 nuts to complete the build
10 x 3mm x 12mm self tapping screws - for the Hall-effect end-stops and LCD case.
8 x M3 x 20mm Socket cap or dome bolts - for the bed catches and mounting the electronics.
15 x M3 x 10mm Socket cap or dome bolts - for the motor's and extruder.
9 x M3 x 6mm dome bolts. I know a silly size, but they are for the Motor Filament spools - you could cut down 10mm ones if they are tricky to get.)
12 x M3 nut's 
12+ Tie-wraps 3.2mm x 100mm for the carriages LM6UU's and tidy up electronics wiring.
3 x M8 nut's (one is used on the Top Boss for the filament spool)
1 x M8 Threaded rod x 120mm for Filament spool
3+ M8 plain Washers
3 x 608ZZ bearings
6 x LM6UU Linear bearings

4 x NEMA17 Stepper Motor's - ideally over 1.2M versions (look for 1.7A or 2.5A)
    max 50mm Long body.  You should be able to use NEMA14 motors too, as the mounts
    are designed to fit both, but I have not yet tried NEMA14's so let me know if
    you try them out.

3 x Hall effect end-stops (I'm using RepRapDiscount versions, here)
1 x RUMBA Electronics (you can use other electronics sets, but 3DR electronic
    mounts are spaced for RUMBA).
    Megatronics electronics also fits nicely into the 3DR. RAMPS it a little
    high but could be made to fit with a small printed adapter.

4 x Pololu stepper motor drivers or equivalents
1 x LCDXXL display and SD card Kit
1 x M8 Hobbed Bolt
1 x J-head MKV 1.75mm or similar / equivalent kit for Hot-end (heater cartridge
    / resistor / thermistor / thermocouple) 1 x Teflon tube 4mm outer 2mm inner x
    500mm long

2 x 1/8" Pneumatic fittings (metal or plastic) 4mm Tube size 
    About 6M of Spectra Line 90Lb (0.5mm) fishing line - or other options that
    are similar.

Material for the Build platform, it's a ~170mm circle 3mm thick - ideal materials are Di-bond, Aluminium or Tufnol. - Glass if you can get a round or hexagon shape.

1 x USB cable.
1 x 60W or higher DC 12V power supply (Brick)

oozing:
  Reversing the extruder motor very quickly allows you to have less oozing.
  Would this not withdraw the filement from the hot end?
