Repeteir-Firmware 0.91 specials:
----------------------------------

- M666, M665 only works in Marlin (for calibrating tower offsets)
- Seems like the DELTA_RADIUS (e.g: adjusting PRINTER_RADIUS is not done anymore), possible use:
  'horizontal radius' (EEPROM via repetier host) instead. But this value does not affect the 
  X0Y0 Z value, instead it will adjust the tower offsets??
  
  From: http://forum.seemecnc.com/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=6361
    when setting the horizontal radius, 0,0,0 will always stay the same, what will change is the z height at the towers.
    I just got done fine tuning mine using a dial indicator, not the paper tuning method, and It really made it easier to understand what was happening.
  
  
  Does it work to calibrate the 'horizontal radius' first then? let's try. But
